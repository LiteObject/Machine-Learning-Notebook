# Machine Learning

## Objective functions
An objective function, also known as a cost function, loss function, or optimization function, is a mathematical function that defines the goal or objective of an optimization problem. In optimization, the objective function quantifies the performance or quality of a solution or a set of parameters.

The objective function is typically designed to be minimized or maximized based on the problem's requirements. For example, in a minimization problem, the objective function should be minimized, while in a maximization problem, the objective function should be maximized.

In various fields, such as mathematics, engineering, economics, and machine learning, objective functions play a crucial role in optimization problems. They help define the criteria for finding the optimal solution, which could be the solution that minimizes cost, maximizes profit, minimizes error, maximizes accuracy, or satisfies certain constraints.

For instance, in linear regression, the objective function could be the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values. In logistic regression, the objective function could be the negative log-likelihood of the model's predictions.

The choice of an objective function depends on the specific problem being solved and the desired outcome. It is essential to carefully define and design the objective function to accurately capture the problem's requirements and guide the optimization process towards the desired solution.

## Optimizer
In the context of machine learning, an optimizer is an algorithm or method used to adjust the parameters of a model in order to minimize the error or loss function during the training process. The optimizer plays a crucial role in the training phase of machine learning models, as it determines how the model's parameters are updated in response to the training data.

During the training phase, the model iteratively makes predictions on the training data and calculates the associated error or loss. The optimizer then adjusts the model's parameters based on the error, aiming to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

Commonly used optimizers in machine learning include:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD is a widely used optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest gradient. It performs parameter updates based on a small batch of randomly selected training examples at each iteration.
- Adam: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines ideas from both momentum and RMSProp. It adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the first and second moments of the gradients.
- RMSProp: RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the average of the squared gradients. It helps to mitigate the vanishing or exploding gradient problem.
- Adagrad: Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient) is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the sum of the historical squared gradients. It gives more weight to less frequently occurring features by decreasing the learning rate for frequently occurring features.
- AdamW: AdamW is an extension of Adam that incorporates weight decay regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large parameter values.
  
These optimizers, and many others, provide different strategies for updating the model's parameters and adjusting the learning rate during the training process. The choice of optimizer depends on the specific problem, the characteristics of the data, and the model architecture. Experimenting with different optimizers can help improve the model's convergence and overall performance.
