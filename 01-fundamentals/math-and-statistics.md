# Mathematics and Statistics for Machine Learning

## Linear Algebra
Matrices, vectors, matrix operations, and linear transformations are fundamental to many AI and ML algorithms.

## Calculus
Understanding derivatives and gradients is important for optimizing models and training algorithms.

## Probability Theory
Probability concepts, such as conditional probability and Bayes' theorem, are essential for understanding probabilistic models and algorithms.

## Statistics
Concepts like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis are crucial for analyzing data and evaluating models.

## Optimization
Knowledge of optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, is necessary for training machine learning models.
