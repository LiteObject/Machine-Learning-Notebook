RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a model that combines the power of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for 
natural language processing tasks. The embedding process in RAG involves representing both the documents in the retrieval corpus 
and the input queries (questions) in a meaningful numerical vector format.

RAG utilizes a two-step embedding process:

1. Document Embedding:
   - First, the documents in the retrieval corpus are preprocessed. This typically involves tokenization, lowercasing, and removing
     stopwords and punctuation.
   - Each preprocessed document is then passed through a pretrained language model, such as BERT or T5, to obtain contextualized word
     embeddings. These embeddings capture the meaning and context of each word in the document.
   - To represent the entire document, the individual word embeddings are combined. This can be done by taking the mean or max pooling
     over the word embeddings.
   - The resulting document embeddings represent the semantic content of each document in the retrieval corpus. 
3. Query Embedding:
   - The input query (question) undergoes a similar preprocessing step as the documents, including tokenization and lowercasing.
   - The preprocessed query is also passed through the same pretrained language model to obtain contextualized word embeddings.
   - Similar to the document embedding, the word embeddings for the query are combined to obtain a single query embedding that captures
     its semantic meaning.

The document and query embeddings are then used to perform retrieval and ranking of relevant documents for a given query. This is 
typically done by measuring the similarity between the query embedding and document embeddings using methods like cosine similarity or 
dot product. The documents with the highest similarity scores are considered the most relevant to the query.

Once the relevant documents are retrieved, RAG can utilize the retrieved information to generate relevant and coherent responses. 
The retrieved documents serve as a knowledge source that can be used to augment the generation process, allowing the model to provide 
accurate and informative responses.

Overall, the embedding process in RAG involves encoding both the documents and queries into meaningful numerical representations, 
enabling effective retrieval and generation of natural language responses.
