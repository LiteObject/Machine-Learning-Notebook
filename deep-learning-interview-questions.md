# Deep Learning Questions & Answers

### **1. Neural Network Fundamentals & Architecture**
*   **What is deep learning, and how does it differ from machine learning?**
    - Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks). While traditional ML often requires manual feature engineering, deep learning automatically learns features from raw data through multiple layers of abstraction.

*   **Can you explain the concept of an artificial neural network?**
    - An artificial neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information by passing signals through weighted connections and applying activation functions.

*   **What are the differences between a feedforward neural network and a recurrent neural network?**
    - Feedforward networks process data in one direction (input â†’ output) with no cycles. RNNs have connections that loop back, allowing them to maintain memory of previous inputs, making them suitable for sequential data.

*   **How do you select the number of layers and nodes in a neural network?**
    - Start simple and increase complexity as needed. Consider: problem complexity, amount of training data, computational resources, and use techniques like cross-validation. Common approach: start with 2-3 hidden layers and adjust based on performance.

*   **What is the purpose of the activation function in a neural network?**
    - Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns. Without them, even deep networks would only learn linear relationships, limiting their power.

*   **What are activation functions, and why are they used?**
    - Activation functions are mathematical operations applied to neuron outputs (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh). They enable networks to model non-linear relationships and decide whether a neuron should "fire" based on its input.

*   **How do you choose an appropriate activation function for your neural network?**
    - Hidden layers: ReLU (default choice - fast, avoids vanishing gradient). Output layer: Sigmoid (binary classification), Softmax (multi-class), Linear (regression). Consider: gradient flow, computation speed, and output range.

*   **Explain the concept of weight initialization in deep learning. Why is it important?**
    - Weight initialization sets starting values for network parameters. Proper initialization (e.g., Xavier, He) prevents vanishing/exploding gradients and ensures effective training from the start. Poor initialization can lead to slow or failed convergence.

*   **What is the role of a loss function in deep learning?**
    - The loss function measures how wrong the model's predictions are. It provides a single number that the optimization algorithm minimizes during training, guiding the model toward better predictions.

*   **What is backpropagation, and why is it important in deep learning?**
    - Backpropagation is the algorithm for calculating gradients of the loss with respect to each weight. It efficiently computes how to adjust weights to reduce error by propagating the error backward through the network.

### **2. Training, Optimization & Gradient Problems**
*   **What is the vanishing gradient problem, and how does it affect the training of deep neural networks?**
    - When gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through many layers, weights in early layers barely update. This causes slow or stalled learning in deep networks.

*   **What is the vanishing gradient problem, and how can it be addressed?**
    - Solutions include: using ReLU activation (maintains gradient flow), batch normalization, residual connections (ResNet), proper weight initialization, and gradient clipping.

*   **How does the learning rate impact the training process in deep learning?**
    - Learning rate controls step size during optimization. Too high: training diverges or oscillates. Too low: training is slow or gets stuck. Optimal rate enables fast, stable convergence.

*   **What is the difference between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mini-batch gradient descent?**
    - SGD updates weights after each sample (noisy but can escape local minima). Mini-batch updates after a small group of samples (balances computation efficiency with gradient stability). Batch GD uses entire dataset (stable but computationally expensive).

*   **What are some common optimization algorithms used in training deep neural networks?**
    - Adam (adaptive learning rates, most popular), SGD with momentum (adds velocity), RMSprop (adapts learning rate per parameter), AdaGrad (accumulates gradients), AdamW (Adam with decoupled weight decay).

*   **Explain the concept of gradient clipping and when it is used in training neural networks.**
    - Gradient clipping limits the maximum gradient value to prevent exploding gradients. Commonly used in RNNs where long sequences can cause gradient explosion. Clips by value or by norm.

*   **How does batch size impact the training of a neural network?**
    - Larger batches: more stable gradients, better GPU utilization, but less regularization. Smaller batches: noisier updates (can help escape local minima), more frequent updates, but slower per epoch.

*   **What is the importance of feature scaling in neural networks?**
    - Feature scaling ensures all inputs are on similar scales, preventing features with large values from dominating. This leads to faster convergence and more stable training.

*   **What is the role of data normalization in deep learning?**
    - Normalization (scaling data to standard range) improves training stability, speeds convergence, and prevents numerical issues. Common methods: min-max scaling, standardization (z-score).

### **3. Regularization & Preventing Overfitting**
*   **How do you prevent overfitting in a deep learning model?**
    - Use dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, reduce model complexity, increase training data, batch normalization, and cross-validation.

*   **What is the role of dropout regularization, and how does it work?**
    - Dropout randomly "drops" neurons during training (sets output to zero). This prevents co-adaptation of neurons, forces redundant representations, and acts like training multiple models.

*   **Can you explain the concept of 'dropout' in neural networks?**
    - During training, dropout randomly deactivates neurons with probability p (typically 0.2-0.5). At test time, all neurons are active but outputs are scaled. This creates an ensemble effect.

*   **Discuss the concept of batch normalization and its advantages in deep learning.**
    - Batch normalization normalizes inputs to each layer using batch statistics. Benefits: faster training, higher learning rates, less sensitive to initialization, acts as regularization.

*   **What is the significance of batch normalization in neural networks?**
    - It reduces internal covariate shift (changing input distributions), stabilizes training, allows deeper networks, and often improves generalization. Applied before or after activation functions.

### **4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) & Computer Vision**
*   **What are the key components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?**
    - Convolutional layers (feature detection), pooling layers (downsampling), activation functions (non-linearity), fully connected layers (classification), and optionally batch normalization and dropout.

*   **How does a convolution operation work in a CNN?**
    - A filter (kernel) slides across the input, computing dot products at each position. This creates feature maps that detect patterns like edges, textures, or shapes. Filters are learned during training.

*   **What is the significance of pooling in CNNs?**
    - Pooling reduces spatial dimensions, decreases computation, provides translation invariance, and helps prevent overfitting. Max pooling keeps strongest features; average pooling smooths features.

*   **How can deep learning be used for image and video analysis?**
    - Classification (identifying objects), detection (locating objects), segmentation (pixel-level classification), facial recognition, style transfer, video action recognition, and image generation.

### **5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs & Sequence Modeling**
*   **How do Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) differ from traditional neural networks?**
    - RNNs have loops allowing information persistence across time steps. They share weights across sequences and maintain hidden states, making them suitable for sequential data like text or time series.

*   **How do LSTM networks differ from standard RNNs?**
    - LSTMs solve vanishing gradient problem using gates (forget, input, output) and cell state. They can learn long-term dependencies that standard RNNs struggle with.

*   **Can you describe the structure of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell?**
    - LSTM has: cell state (long-term memory), hidden state (short-term memory), forget gate (what to discard), input gate (what to store), output gate (what to output). Gates use sigmoid activations.

*   **What are attention mechanisms in neural networks?**
    - Attention computes weighted importance scores for different parts of input. Uses query, key, value vectors to determine where to "pay attention." Self-attention relates different positions within same sequence.

*   **Can you explain the architecture of a Transformer model, and how is it used in natural language processing tasks?**
