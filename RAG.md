# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines the power of retrieval-based methods and generative models in natural language processing. In simple terms, it involves using a retrieval system to fetch relevant information or context, which is then used by a generative model to generate a response or output.

Here's how it works: First, a retrieval system is employed to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus or knowledge base. This retrieval can be based on keywords, similarity measures, or other techniques. Once the relevant information is obtained, a generative model, such as a language model or a neural network, utilizes this retrieved context to generate a response or output.

This approach allows the generative model to benefit from the knowledge and context present in the retrieved information, enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated output. It can be particularly useful in tasks like dialogue systems, question answering, or content generation, where having access to relevant information can greatly improve the generated responses.

In essence, Retrieval Augmented Generation combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods, which excel at finding relevant information, with generative models, which are skilled at generating coherent and context-aware responses. This synergy enables more effective and contextually grounded natural language generation.

```

Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

### Query Processing:

- The process starts with a **Query**, which is used to retrieve relevant **Documents**.
- The documents are then **Split** into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- **Embeddings** are generated for each chunk and stored in a VectorDB.

### Context Creation:

- The **Context** is created by combining the **Query** with the relevant **Document Chunks** and **Embeddings**.

### Prompt Generation:

- The **Context** is passed to a **Prompt Template**, which structures it into a format compatible with the **LLM**.
- The prompt is then passed to the **LLM**, which generates **Text**.

### Retrieval:

- In addition to the main RAG process, the diagram also includes a **Retrieval** subgraph.
- The **Query** is passed to a **Retrieval Model**, which retrieves **Relevant Documents**.
- These **Relevant Documents** are then used to enhance the **Prompt Template**, providing additional context for the LLM.

## Related Concepts:

- The diagram also acknowledges other related concepts, such as **Relevance Scoring**, **Summarization**, **Question Answering**, and **Dialogue**. These concepts can be integrated into the RAG process to improve its effectiveness.
