# Misc Notes

### Slug
A slug typically refers to a short, human-readable text string that is used to identify a specific resource, such as 
a dataset, model, or project. It is often used in URLs or file names to provide a concise and descriptive identifier. 
For example, a slug for a machine learning project on image recognition could be "image-recognition-project". Slugs 
are useful for organizing and referencing resources in a more user-friendly manner.

### Quantization 
Quantization refers to the process of reducing the precision or number of bits used to represent numerical values. 
It involves converting continuous values into a discrete set of values. Quantization is often used to compress models 
or reduce memory usage, making them more efficient for deployment on resource-constrained devices. For example, instead 
of using 32-bit floating-point numbers, quantization may reduce them to 8-bit integers. This can result in faster 
computations and reduced storage requirements, albeit with a slight loss in precision.

### Inference
Inference refers to the process of using a trained model to make predictions or draw conclusions based on new, unseen 
data. It involves applying the learned knowledge from the model to make decisions or generate outputs. For example, if 
a model is trained to classify images of cats and dogs, inference would involve using the trained model to predict whether 
a new image contains a cat or a dog. Inference is a crucial step in utilizing machine learning models for real-world applications.
