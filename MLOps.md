# Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps, is a set of practices and techniques that aim to streamline the deployment, management, and monitoring of machine learning models in production.

It combines principles from software engineering and data science to ensure the smooth operation of machine learning systems. 

MLOps involves tasks such as version control, model training, testing, deployment, and continuous monitoring to ensure the models perform well and remain up-to-date. It helps organizations effectively manage and scale their machine learning workflows.

>Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle. ML professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows to train and deploy models and manage machine learning operations (MLOps).

>You can create a model in Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.
