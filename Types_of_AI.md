# Types of Artificial Intelligence

There are several ways to classify artificial intelligence (AI) based on its capabilities and functionality. Two common classifications are based on the likeness to the human mind and the level of intelligence. Here are the main types of AI:

## Based on Likeness to the Human Mind:
- Reactive Machines: These are the oldest and simplest forms of AI. They can respond to stimuli but do not have memory-based functionality or the ability to learn from past experience.
- Limited Memory: These AI systems can learn from historical data and use that knowledge to make decisions. They are trained using large volumes of data and can improve their operations based on past experiences.
- Theory of Mind: This type of AI is still in the concept or work-in-progress stage. It aims to understand entities by discerning their needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes. Achieving this level of AI requires development in various branches of AI, including emotional intelligence.
- Self-aware: This is a hypothetical type of AI that has evolved to be similar to the human brain and has developed self-awareness. It can understand and evoke emotions in others and have its own emotions, needs, beliefs, and desires. Self-aware AI is currently only a theoretical concept.

## Based on Level of Intelligence:
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): This refers to existing AI systems that can perform specific tasks autonomously using human-like capabilities. ANI has a limited range of competencies and can only do what it is programmed to do.
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI aims to replicate human-like intelligence and perform multiple tasks simultaneously. It can learn, perceive, understand, and function like a human being, cutting down on training time and forming connections across domains.
- Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): ASI represents the most advanced form of AI, surpassing human intelligence in all tasks. It has greater memory, faster data processing and analysis, and superior decision-making capabilities. ASI development could lead to a scenario known as the singularity.
