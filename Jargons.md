### GAN
GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Network. It is a type of ML model that consists of two components: a generator and a disciminator. The generator tries to create realistic data, such as images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. They both improve through adversarial training, where the generator aims to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator aims to correctly classify the data.

### VAE
VAE stands for Variational Autoencoder. It is a type of generative model that leans to encode and decode data. The encoder part of the model learns a compressed representation of the input data, called the latent space. The decoder part reconstructs the original data from the latent space. VAEs are often used for tasks like image generation and data compression.
