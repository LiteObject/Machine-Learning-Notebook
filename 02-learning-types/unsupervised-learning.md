# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition
Machine learning technique where the model learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data without specific guidance. The algorithm must find hidden patterns or structures in data without being told what to look for.

## Key Characteristics
- No labeled training data
- Goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures
- No predefined correct answers
- Exploratory in nature

## Types of Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering
- Groups similar data points together
- Examples: Customer segmentation, gene analysis, image segmentation
- Common algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

### Association Rules
- Finds relationships between different items
- Examples: Market basket analysis, recommendation systems
- Common algorithms: Apriori, FP-Growth

### Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduces the number of features while preserving important information
- Examples: Data visualization, noise reduction, feature extraction
- Common algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, UMAP

### Anomaly Detection
- Identifies unusual patterns or outliers
- Examples: Fraud detection, network security, quality control
- Common algorithms: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders

## Common Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

### K-Means Clustering
Groups data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.

### Hierarchical Clustering
Creates a tree of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting clusters.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Reduces dimensionality by finding the principal components that explain the most variance.

### DBSCAN
Density-based clustering that can find clusters of arbitrary shape and identify outliers.

## Advantages
- No need for labeled data
- Can discover unexpected patterns
- Useful for exploratory data analysis
- Can handle large datasets efficiently

## Disadvantages
- Difficult to evaluate results objectively
- May find patterns that aren't meaningful
- Results can be hard to interpret
- Requires domain expertise to validate findings
