# Supervised Learning

## Definition
A type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, where the correct answers are provided during training.

## Key Characteristics
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs
- Performance can be measured against known correct answers
- Two main types: classification and regression

## Types of Supervised Learning

### Classification
- Predicts discrete categories or classes
- Examples: Email spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis
- Common algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

### Regression
- Predicts continuous numerical values
- Examples: Price prediction, temperature forecasting, stock market analysis
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Neural Networks

## Common Supervised Learning Algorithms

### Linear Regression
Models the relationship between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable using a linear equation.

### Logistic Regression
Models the probability of a binary outcome or class membership based on independent variables using a logistic function.

### Decision Trees
Models decisions or classifications by splitting the data based on a series of hierarchical rules or conditions.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Models data by finding a hyperplane that best separates different classes or groups.

### Neural Networks
Deep learning models composed of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that can learn complex patterns and relationships.

### Naive Bayes
A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem that predicts the probability of different outcomes based on independent features.

## Advantages
- Clear performance metrics
- Well-understood algorithms
- Good for problems with available labeled data
- Interpretable results in many cases

## Disadvantages
- Requires labeled data (can be expensive to obtain)
- May not generalize well to unseen data patterns
- Susceptible to overfitting
- Performance depends heavily on quality of training data
